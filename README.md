# Instacart Grocery Analysis
## Introduction
This repository presents a comprehensive exploratory analysis of Instacart's sales data, aimed at identifying key customer purchasing behaviors. Acting as an analyst for Instacart, the objective is to generate actionable insights to support targeted marketing strategies. The analysis responds to critical inquiries from the sales and marketing teams, such as determining peak order times, analyzing spending habits, and assessing product popularity across departments. Furthermore, the project explores customer segmentation, investigating behavioral differences based on brand loyalty, region, age, income, and family structure. These findings will enable Instacart to design more effective marketing campaigns, drive sales growth, and enhance the relevance of promotions and advertisements.
